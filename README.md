## General Information
In today's world, the need for energy conservation is more pressing than ever, both for environmental sustainability and cost savings. However, many individuals find it challenging to effectively monitor and manage their energy usage. Traditional methods often lack the ability to provide real-time data and actionable insights, making it difficult for users to identify inefficient patterns, optimize their consumption, and control energy-related devices remotely. This disconnect hinders efforts to achieve greater energy efficiency in both residential and commercial settings.

To address this challenge, I developed the PowerGaze web application, a practical example of how technology can empower users to take control of their energy consumption. PowerGaze provides an intuitive, real-time dashboard that allows users to monitor their energy use and remotely control connected devices to optimize energy efficiency. The application was built using a modern tech stack, combining a user-friendly frontend with a robust backend that ensures scalability and data security. This project not only serves as a showcase of my frontend development skills but also highlights the potential of practical technological solutions to make a meaningful impact on energy management and sustainability.
